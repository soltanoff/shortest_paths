# The determination of shortest paths in the graph

This project is a laboratory work on the subject of "Networks and Telecommunication"

Distribution channels and information flows on the communication line is adapted 
to the length of the path. For evaluation of path length are used different 
criteria: the number of hops between the communicating nodes of the switching 
(the criminal code); the length of the path; the quality of the transmission 
path; transmission reliability, etc.

The shortest way of transmitting information is called a path, for 
which the criterion of the length of the path has the smallest value 
compared to its value for other possible ways.

In theory flow all the methods of selection of shortest paths is based on the 
assertion that if the shortest path from an arbitrary mij Ook to UK passes through 
intermediate YК1,..., YKk (Fig. 1), the shortest paths μi1,..., μkj are parts of the 
shortest path from μij YK to YK.
